# Is JSX mandatory for React?

NO

# Is ES6 mandatory for React?

NO

# {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX

all of them are same but called in different forms

# How can I write comments in JSX?

1. /_
   This is a
   multi-line comment
   in JSX
   _/

2. // - used for single line comment.

# What is <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></> ?

<React.Fragment> and <> </> (short syntax) are both ways to create a React Fragment. Fragments are a feature in React that allows you to group multiple elements without introducing an additional parent container into the DOM.

# What is Virtual DOM?

The Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is a concept used in React to improve the performance and efficiency of updating the user interface. It is an abstraction of the HTML DOM and is used as an intermediary representation of the user interface in memory.

Here's how the Virtual DOM works in React:

1. **Initial Render:**
   When a React component is initially rendered or updated, it creates a virtual representation of the DOM elements that make up the user interface.

2. **Virtual DOM Structure:**
   The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. It is a tree-like structure that mirrors the structure of the HTML elements in your application.

3. **Changes and Reconciliation:**
   When the state of a React component changes (due to user interactions, data updates, etc.), a new virtual DOM is created. This new virtual DOM is then compared with the previous virtual DOM using a process called "reconciliation."

4. **Diffing Algorithm:**
   React uses a "diffing" algorithm to identify the differences between the new virtual DOM and the previous one. It calculates the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM to reflect the new state.

5. **Update to Actual DOM:**
   Once the differences are calculated, React updates only the specific parts of the actual DOM that have changed. This selective updating is more efficient than re-rendering the entire DOM.

The benefits of using the Virtual DOM include:

- **Efficiency:** Updating the virtual DOM is faster than directly manipulating the actual DOM. React optimizes the process by minimizing the number of updates to the real DOM.

- **Consistency:** The virtual DOM ensures a consistent view of the UI across different browsers by abstracting away the details of the underlying browser implementation.

- **Ease of Development:** Developers can work with a logical representation of the UI, making it easier to reason about and manage the application's state and updates.

By using the Virtual DOM, React can efficiently update the user interface in response to changes in application state while minimizing the performance impact of those updates.

# What is Reconciliation in React?

The reconciliation process ensures that the user interface is always in sync with the application's state. React's approach to updating only the parts of the DOM that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire DOM, contributes to the framework's performance and efficiency.

# What is React Fiber?

React Fiber is a set of internal algorithms and data structures introduced in React version 16 to improve the way React manages the updating, rendering, and reconciliation of components.

# Why we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React?

In React, keys are used to help React identify which items in a list or collection have changed, been added, or been removed. They are crucial for efficient updates and performance optimizations during the process of reconciliation, where React updates the Virtual DOM and determines how to synchronize it with the actual DOM.

# Can we use index as keys in React?

While it is possible to use the array index as keys in React, it is generally not recommended in most situations. Using array indices as keys can lead to unexpected behavior and issues, especially when the list is dynamic and elements can be added, removed, or reordered.

# What is props in React?

In React, "props" is short for properties, and it is a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to its child components. Props allow you to create dynamic and customizable components by passing values from one component to another. Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.

# What is a Config Driven UI ?

A Config-Driven UI (User Interface) refers to a design and development approach where the configuration or settings of a user interface are defined separately from the application's source code. Instead of hardcoding UI elements and behaviors, the UI is dynamically generated or customized based on a configuration file, data structure, or set of parameters.
