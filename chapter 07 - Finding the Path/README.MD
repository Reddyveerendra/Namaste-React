# Adding Images to React App

In a React application, there are several ways to add images. Here are some common methods:

1. **Importing Images in JavaScript/JSX:**
   You can import images directly into your JavaScript or JSX files using the `import` statement. This is useful for smaller images or icons.

   ```jsx
   import React from "react";
   import logo from "./images/logo.png";

   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```
````

In this example, the `logo.png` file is assumed to be in the same directory as the component file.

2. **Using the `public` Folder:**
   You can place your images in the `public` folder of your React project, and then reference them directly. This is useful for larger images or when you want to maintain a folder structure.

   ```jsx
   import React from "react";

   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + "/images/logo.png"} alt="Logo" />
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

   This assumes the image is located in the `public/images` directory.

3. **Inline Images with Base64:**
   For small images, you can convert them to Base64 and include them directly in your code. This can be done using tools like `url-loader` or `file-loader` with Webpack.

   ```jsx
   import React from "react";
   import logoBase64 from "./images/logoBase64.txt";

   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         <img src={logoBase64} alt="Logo" />
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

   The `logoBase64.txt` file contains the Base64-encoded image data.

4. **CSS Background Images:**
   You can use CSS to set background images. This is often used for styling purposes.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import './App.css'; // Import your CSS file with styles

   function App() {
     return (
       <div className="app-container">
         {/* Styles in App.css */}
       </div>
     );
   }

   // App.css
   .app-container {
     background-image: url('./images/background.jpg');
     background-size: cover;
     /* Other styles... */
   }
   ```

# useEffect Behavior Without Dependency Array

If you don't provide a dependency array to the useEffect hook in React, it means that the effect will run after every render. This behavior is equivalent to having an empty dependency array.

# What is SPA?

SPA stands for Single Page Application.

# Difference Between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing

**Client-Side Routing:**

- Navigation handled in the browser using JavaScript, updating content without server requests (common in SPAs).

**Server-Side Routing:**

- Server manages navigation, responding with entire HTML pages for each request, leading to full-page reloads.
