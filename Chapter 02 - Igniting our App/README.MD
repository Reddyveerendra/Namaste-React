# What is `NPM`?

NPM is a package manager used by JavaScript during development to manage and install packages and dependencies.

# What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?

Parcel/Webpack are bundler modules used in web development. They are responsible for bundling and managing various assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) in a web application. They help optimize the project structure and improve performance.

# What is `.parcel-cache`?

It is a folder that stores information about the project when Parcel builds to reduce compilation time and improve performance.

# What is `npx`?

npx is a npm package runner tool. It is used to execute packages from the npm registry as well as commands from local package binaries.

# What is the difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?

**dependencies:**
1. Needed for the application to work.
2. Installed when people use your app.

**devDependencies:**
1. Only needed during development (for testing, building, etc.).
2. Not installed when people use your app.

# What is Tree Shaking?

Tree Shaking is a technique used in JavaScript build tools (like Webpack) for dead code elimination. It removes unused or dead code during the build process, resulting in a smaller and more optimized bundle.

# What is Hot Module Replacement?

Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature that allows developers to replace, add, or remove modules in a running application without a full page reload. It provides a faster development experience by updating only the modules that have changed.

# List down your favorite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words

1. **HMR:** Allows real-time updates of changed modules during development.
2. **Built-in Development Server:** Simplifies local development by serving the bundled application and providing features like automatic browser refresh.
3. **Zero Configuration:** Requires no manual configuration, making it easy to set up projects quickly.

# What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?

`.gitignore` is a file where you define which files or directories should be ignored and not committed to Git. It is used to exclude files like node_modules, build artifacts, and other non-essential files from version control.

# What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`?

`package.json` is used for project configuration and lists project metadata and dependencies. `package-lock.json` is automatically generated and locks down the specific version of each dependency to ensure consistency across different installations.

# Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?

To maintain Dependency Consistency, Version Control, Bug Prevention, and Integrity.

# What is `node_modules`? Is it a good idea to push that on Git?

`node_modules` is a directory where npm installs project dependencies. It is not a good idea to push it to Git because it contains a large number of files and can be easily regenerated by running `npm install` based on the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.

# What is the `dist` folder?

`dist` is a folder where all files are outputted after the build process. It contains optimized and compiled code that is ready for deployment.

# Read about: ^ - caret and ~ - tilde

^ is used in dependencies to allow updates that do not include breaking changes. ~ is used to allow only patch-level updates.

# What is Browserslist?

Browserslist is a tool used to specify which browsers should be supported in your frontend app by defining queries in a config file. It helps in optimizing and targeting specific browser versions.
