  "description": "The `lazy()` function in React serves the purpose of code-splitting, a technique used to optimize the loading of JavaScript bundles. By dynamically importing modules, you can defer the loading of certain parts of your application until they are actually needed. This helps in improving initial loading times, especially in large single-page applications.",
